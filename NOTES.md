- editor is created and passed to Slate component to make it available via contexts. The particular editor instance is built based on the editor returned by `createEditor` but is augmented using plugins that attach methods to it. In some cases it replaces / wraps existing ones. For example, the slate-dom plugin attaches an `apply` method that wraps the base editor `apply` with things that need to be updated any time slate applies an operation. This customized editor instance is passed through the various util functions, so when they call editor.apply, the custom logic is run. The last thing that happens in the base `apply` is the operation get passed to `editor.onChange`. The `slate-dom` plugin implements this to call `onContextChange` which is stored in a WeakMap named `EDITOR_TO_ON_CHANGE`. This causes the Slate context to re-render.
- Editable handles selection and onbeforeinput DOM events. In the related event handlers, the editor gets passed to utils in 'slate' package to manipulate the selection / children of the editor.
